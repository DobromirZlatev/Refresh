REFRESH 2.0

1) Add DB
2) Set and change options from console
3) Save list of file names / details in db so it can be called through the console: example input: 15/05/2017 would yield a list of files and folders in folder 2017>>05>>15;
4) Renaming of empty folders to [x-Empty] where x is the current name
5) Better exception handling so that it is helpful to the user and they know what they need to do (Example: User needs to close certain documents that are inside the folder that needs to be moved by the process)
6) Hide/Unhide folders
using System.IO; 

string path = @"c:\folders\newfolder"; // or whatever 
if (!Directory.Exists(path)) 
{ 
DirectoryInfo di = Directory.CreateDirectory(path); 
di.Attributes = FileAttributes.Directory | FileAttributes.Hidden; 
}
7) Add continuous functionality while the console is on - Think of what could be helpful
While(true)
{
...
Thread.Sleep(60000)//wait 1 minute
}

7) Add int count = myDir.GetFiles().Length;  [May (54 items)] and [04 (3 items)]

8) Google calendar API to add events and other uses.
